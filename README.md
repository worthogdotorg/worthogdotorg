- 👋 Hi, I’m @worthogdotorg, AKA Frank.
- 👀 I’m interested in Azure, data center migrations to the cloud, Python, food, music and exercise!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure, Python, baking better bread, and how to strum my guitar while I sing along.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting.
